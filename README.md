This repository provides a simple plugin for the [SNAKES-library](https://snakes.ibisc.univ-evry.fr/),
that provides features for building and simulating Stochastic Petri-Nets (SPN) in SNAKES.
Note that it is developed independently of SNAKES
(i.e., any bugs are not to be blamed on the author of SNAKES ðŸ˜‰).
